Simple iOS Weather app which uses the openweathermap API for up to date weather/forecast information.

Parses JSON response from openweathermap when the user enters in a valid US zip code.

The screen then transitions to a tabbed view where 3 tabs are present showing the current weather, a 5-day forecast, and a 7-day forecast.

The current weather tab shows the highs and lows for the day as well as humidity and current wind speed. Finally, the sunrise and sunset times of the day.

As for the forecast screens, data is presented in data cells with the same information presented in the current weather screen. 

The exception is showing the average temperatures over the course of the day instead of the current weather temperature.

In the 7-day forecast screen there is an information button the user can press to obtain more weather information for the selected day.
